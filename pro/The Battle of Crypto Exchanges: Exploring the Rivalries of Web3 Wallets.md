## 1. What is a Web3 Wallet?

### 1.1 Definition of Web3 Wallets

A **Web3 wallet** is a digital wallet that allows users to store, manage, and transact cryptocurrencies and other digital assets on blockchain networks. Unlike traditional wallets, Web3 wallets can interact with decentralized applications (**dApps**) and use private-public key pairs to secure transactions. The private key is the sole credential for accessing and managing wallet assets.

- **Multi-Chain Support**: Manage assets across multiple blockchains with advanced compatibility.
- **Privacy**: Create wallets without revealing sensitive personal data.

### 1.3 Risks and Solutions

#### **Private Key Management**
- **Risk**: Losing your private key results in losing access to your assets.
- **Solution**: Store keys securely offline, use hardware wallets, and regularly back up your keys.

#### **Phishing Attacks**
- **Risk**: Fake websites and apps may trick users into exposing private keys or seed phrases.
- **Solution**: Download wallet software from official sources and verify authenticity.

#### **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**
- **Risk**: Flaws in smart contracts may lead to stolen funds.
- **Solution**: Use well-audited contracts and interact only with reputable dApps.

#### **User Errors**
