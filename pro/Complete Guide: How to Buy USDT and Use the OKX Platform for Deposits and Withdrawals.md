3. Send USDT to this address from your wallet or another exchange.

> **Tip**: Avoid using the ERC20 network for deposits due to its higher fees.

### **Withdrawing USDT**:
1. Go to **My Assets > Withdraw**, and search for **USDT**.
2. Choose **TRC20 Network**, paste the recipient‚Äôs address, and input the amount (e.g., **1001 USDT**, which includes a 1 USDT withdrawal fee).
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the transaction.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Why Add 1 USDT?**  
When withdrawing USDT, always include an additional 1 USDT to cover the withdrawal fee. For example, if your platform deposit request is for **1000 USDT**, withdraw **1001 USDT** to avoid delays.
