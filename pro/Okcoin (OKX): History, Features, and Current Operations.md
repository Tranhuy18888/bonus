## A Brief History of OKX

Founded in 2013 in China by Mingxing "Star" Xu, **OKX** began as Okcoin and quickly established itself as a leader in the cryptocurrency exchange industry. Xu brought his expertise in technology management, honed through roles at Yahoo and Alibaba, to develop a robust platform for trading digital assets.

- OKX raised $10 million through two funding rounds, with the last round concluding in December 2017.
- Headquartered in San Francisco, OKX now operates offices in San Jose, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malta, and Japan.
- The platform serves over one million active investors and traders across 190+ countries.

### Global Reach and Growth

Over the years, OKX has expanded its offerings, enabling users to trade Bitcoin and over 300 other assets in most countries. In the United States, the platform operates under **Okcoin USA**, allowing users to trade Bitcoin and 20 additional cryptocurrencies. The platform also supports over-the-counter (OTC) trading, eliminating slippage for large transactions. 

OKX has also ventured into mobile payments and lending services with its consumer app, available on both the Apple App Store and Google Play.

## Key Features of OKX

### Trading and Availability

- **Supported Regions**: OKX is accessible in 192 countries but is restricted in certain U.S. states (Hawaii, New York, and West Virginia) and U.S. territories.
- **Restricted Countries**: The platform prohibits services in countries like Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Crimea, India, and Malaysia, among others.
- **Regulation**: In the U.S., OKX operates as a registered money services business under the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.

### Security and Transparency

In response to regulatory challenges, OKX updated its terms of service to clarify that digital assets are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). This move followed a cease-and-desist letter from the FDIC in 2023, which highlighted miscommunications regarding asset protection.

### User Education

OKX has been expanding its educational content, offering resources to help users navigate tax and regulatory environments in their regions. The platform also provides guides and tutorials to help users understand cryptocurrency trading and investment strategies.

## Rebranding to OKX

In 2023, Okcoin initiated a global rebranding to consolidate all operations under the **OKX** name. The rebranding began in countries like the Bahamas, Hong Kong, and Brazil, and continued into Europe in 2024. As of December 2024, Okcoin USA is in the process of completing its transition to OKX.

## The Bottom Line

Despite facing regulatory hurdles, **OKX** has established itself as a premier platform for cryptocurrency trading and investment. Its commitment to innovation, user education, and global expansion makes it a leading choice for traders worldwide. Whether you're new to cryptocurrency or an experienced investor, OKX offers tools and features to meet your needs.
